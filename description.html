<section>
<h1>Aims and objectives</h1>
<p>We will develop a proxy certificate auditing infrastructure and demonstrate a solution that enables a thorough auditing and monitoring of proxy credential usage in widely distributed and heterogeneous research environments exemplified by NGS. In undertaking this we shall develop a secure service through which auditing information can be tracked and used for user-level monitoring, virtual organization (VO)-level usage and monitoring, and resource provider-level usage and monitoring. We aim to make this auditing service available to the NGS for longer term auditing and monitoring purposes of its customer and research base, and demonstrate use of this auditing service in international settings.

<section>
 <h1>Methodology</h1>
 <p>We shall establish a proxy credential auditing infrastructure and show how this can be used to identify and predict potential compromise and misuse of proxy credentials. This work will be undertaken by the researchers at TVU and at NeSC in Glasgow. The infrastructure will be demonstrated in numerous projects and application domains including those with an international dimension and exploiting international Grid resources.
